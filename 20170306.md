RISC-V Weekly - #1, Mar 6th 2017
================================

Welcome to the very first issue of RISC-V Weekly, a weekly newsletter
(published every Monday) covering developments in the RISC-V ISA,
RISC-V hardware and software projects, and the RISC-V
community. RISC-V Weekly is brought to you by the RISC-V
Foundation. Please send any tips or feedback to <arun.thomas@acm.org>,
or @arunthomas on Twitter.

RISC-V Weekly is inspired by Alex Bradbury's LLVM Weekly. We thank him
for the fine example.

## RISC-V ISA

Andrew Waterman, as Chair of the Privileged Architecture Task
Group, is leading the effort
[defining the next version of the RISC-V privileged architecture (v1.10)](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/isa-dev/FK_uMx4ufb4).
Andrew plans to "stick to the goal to keep the M-mode ISA
backwards-compatible with 1.9.1, and our goal is that S-mode version
1.10 will be forwards-compatible." You can follow progress in the
[riscv-isa-manual repository](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/issues).
).

Daniel Lustig (announced a new RISC-V Foundation Task Group to
[formally define the memory consistency model for the RISC-V architecture](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/isa-dev/Oxm_IvfYItY). The
group will be led by Daniel Lustig (Nvidia) as Chair and Arvind (MIT)
as Vice Chair.

## RISC-V Software

Palmer Dabbelt announced that
[GNU Binutils 2.28 with RISC-V support has been released](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/sw-dev/RS_wN0-wpCI). This
is a major step for the RISC-V software stack as GNU Binutils is a key
dependency for many operating system distributions as Binutils
provides the system assembler and linker. Palmer and Andrew Waterman
will serve as maintainers of the RISC-V port.

Alec Roelke, who contributed initial RISC-V support to the gem5
architectural simulator, described
[his plans for the RISC-V gem5 port](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/sw-dev/se0TVeaA_JI). gem5/RISC-V
currently supports the newlib toolchain. Alec is working on adding
support for the Linux toolchain. He also hopes to add full system
emulation support and support for running multi-threaded programs in
the coming months.

Michael Gall announced his work on a [RISC-V (RV32I) backend for the
LCC compiler suite](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/sw-dev/Gs_3eru1F5g).


## RISC-V Community

Rick O'Connor sent out a
[call for papers for the 6th RISC-V Workshop](https://riscv.org/2017/03/6th-risc-v-workshop-registration-and-call-for-papers/). We
hope you will consider submitting a paper and/or attending the
Workshop in Shanghai. This will be the first RISC-V Workshop held
outside of the U.S.

The LowRISC project has been accepted as a mentoring organization in
the
[Google Summer of Code program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5710050115977216/). If
you are a university student who is interested in working on RISC-V
this summer, please consider applying.

### 6th RISC-V Workshop - Shanghai, China - May 8-11, 2017

Registration and the call for presentations / posters is open for the
6th RISC-V Workshop, co-hosted by NVIDIA and the Shanghai Jiao Tong
University (SJTU) in Shanghai China on May 8-11, 2017.  As with past
workshops, our goals for these events are to bring the RISC-V
community together to share information about recent activity in the
various RISC-V projects underway around the globe, and build consensus
on the future evolution of the instruction set.
